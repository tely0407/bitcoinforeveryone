          What is Bitcoin?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin is the most secure financial ledger in the world. It is
          disinflationary money and digital cash. Disinflationary means that
          Bitcoins inflation is reduced by 50% every 4 years until it gets close
          to 0. There will only ever be 21 million coins. It can be used to
          transfer billions in value worldwide or for millions of micro
          transactions per second on the lightning network for in-game payments
          or the internet of things. It is also programmable money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin is decentralized. Everybody can have a copy of the "bitcoin
          server" (Bitcoin full-node) with all the transactions ever made. There
          is no "Bitcoin company" and you don't need to sign up anywhere. All
          you need is a Bitcoin wallet. There are paper wallets, software
          wallets and hardware wallets. These wallets contain the keys to the
          Bitcoins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoins are not stored on your computer or phone, they are stored on
          the decentralized Bitcoin computer network (Blockchain) and can be
          accessed with a password (also called private key).
        </p>
        <p>
          Bitcoin is permissionless. This means that you can use Bitcoin to
          accept payments for your business without signing up anywhere or doing
          any paperwork. Just post your Bitcoin address or qr code on your
          website or use an open source payment provider like BTCPayserver.
        </p>
        <h2 id="energy">Does Bitcoin unnecessarily waste too much energy?</h2>
        <p>
          Many pepole think that Bitcoin unnecessarily wastes energy because of
          an arbitrary algorithm that could simply be changed to a different
          energy saving algorithm. Bitcoin mining is not arbitrary. Mining is
          what makes Bitcoin the most secure computer network in the world. It
          takes energy, an expensive resource from the real world, and uses it
          in a security mechanism in the digital world to solve the
          double-spending problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The double-spending problem shortly explained:</b> In the digital
          world, you can send the same file or email as often as you want. A
          digital money system only works if the same coin can't be sent
          multiple times. Otherwise everybody in the system could just send the
          same 1000$ to different merchants and effectively have infinite money.
          The great innovation in Bitcoin is that it solved this problem of
          digital scarcity with proof of work mining.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world's hydro, biofuel, solar and wind energy combined could power
          the Bitcoin network 98 times. The amount of electricity consumed every
          year in always-on but inactive home devices in the USA alone could
          power the Bitcoin network for 3.5 years. See these comparisons and
          others here:
          <a href="https://cbeci.org/cbeci/comparisons"  style="text-decoration: none"target="_blank"
            >cbeci.org/cbeci/comparisons</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people fear that Bitcoin can worsen climate change. Since it only
          uses a small fraction of the global energy produced, these fears are
          of course blown out of proportion. Bitcoin could actually be part of
          the solution to climate change. Thanks to Bitcoin, energy companies
          now have a way to monetize excess energy and renewable energy that is
          too remote to use for civilization. Energy companies that mine Bitcoin
          will be incentivized to increase renewable energy conversion
          efficiency in a race to be the most profitable Bitcoin miner.
        </p>

        <p>
          This blog article from the International Energy Agency explains
          Bitcoins energy consumption:

          >
        </p>

        <p>
          As you can see, there is no reason to be afraid of Bitcoins energy
          consumption.

          Does the Bitcoin price go up and down too much? (Is it too volatile?)
        </h2>

          <img

        <p>
          The above image shows the history of the Bitcoin price until 10.
          August 2019. Bitcoin goes up and down like nothing else. The news
          frequently writes that Bitcoin has crashed or that it is dead. People
          therefore repeatedly dismiss Bitcoin as a failed or dead project. The
          above price history shows that despite the regular 85% crashes Bitcoin
          has had a positive price discovery since 2010.
        </p>

        <h2 id="betterthanfiat">Is Bitcoin better than normal money?</h2>
        <p>
          There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin. "Normal money" like US
          Dollars or Euros dont have a fixed supply and can be created by the
          government and by private banks for their personal advantage. This
          gives them too much power and inflates the money supply. The rising
          money supply causes the money to loose value every year. This is
          called inflation and causes the price of goods and services to go up
          because the money is worth less. Bitcoin on the other hand can not be
          inflated by governments or private banks. In Bitcoin, the same rules
          apply for everybody.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following video is the best explanation I could find on how the
          process of money creation works:
        </p>

        <h2 id="deflation" style="text-decoration: none">Can a deflationary economy work?</h2>
        <p>
          In a world where Bitcoin is the dominant money, the prices of goods
          and services would go down because the value of Bitcoin goes up over
          time thanks to the law of demand and supply. When more people want a
          piece of the limited supply of 21 million coins, the price increases.
          Even after mass adoption, when almost everybody in the world uses
          Bitcoin, the value would still go up over time. Growing populations
          and economies would cause a steady increase in demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many economists believe that an economy can't work with deflation
          because people and companies wont spend nor invest because they would
          rather keep the Bitcoin and watch it increase in value. This would
          slow economic growth and increase unemployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a world view that doesn't hold up to scrutiny. People will
          always have wants and needs and companies will always want to
          innovate. Some forms of spending would be disincentivized in a Bitcoin
          economy which could be a good thing. A debt-fueled economy like we
          have today, with easy money, produces a lot of bullshit since people
          don't need to put a lot of effort into fundraising. In a Bitcoin world
          there wont be much easy money floating around funding bullshit. A
          Bitcoin world could incentivize thoughtful spending which could lead
          to a more sustainable long-term way of thinking in everyday life and
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another aspect to consider is that humanity, motivated by never ending
          economic growth, has exploited the worlds resources and emitted carbon
          dioxide to a point where ecological disasters are likely to increase.
          It would be prudent to study and experiment with ways to run societies
          with less or negative economic growth. This school of thought is
          called the degrowth or post-growth movement.
        </p>

        <h2 id="whyithasvalue">Why does Bitcoin have value?</h2>
        <p>
          Modern technologies usually capture value by disrupting old
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are old technologies or industries that Bitcoin is disrupting:
        </p>

        <p><b>GOLD</b> (Bitcoin is rarer and more practical than gold)</p>
        <p>
          <b>MONEY</b> (Bitcoin is sound money with a fixed inflation schedule
          that goes towards 0)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</b> (negative interest rates vs appreciating
          asset)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>STOCKS</b> (other digital assets can be created on Bitcoin side
          chains like the Liquid network)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>REMITTANCES</b> (send Bitcoin to anyone in the world for a few
          cents vs 10% Western Union fees)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>BLACK MARKETS</b> (people will prefer to buy their stuff online
          from vendors with positive reviews vs. the scary guy on the street)
        </p>
        <p><b>TAX HAVENS</b> (Swiss bank account in your pocket)</p>

        <p>
          These are all trillion dollar markets. The more Bitcoin eats into
          these industries, more valuable it becomes.
        </p>

        <h2 id="whoneedsit">Who needs Bitcoin?</h2>
        <p>
          People in the western world have a hard time understanding why we need
          Bitcoin. Bitcoin is most necessary in countries without stable
          currencies, or with authoritarian restrictive regimes, where Bitcoin
          is used to protect wealth from inflation or confiscation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notable examples of individuals in the western world who needed
          Bitcoin are whistle blower Edward Snowden and Wikileaks founder Julian
          Assange. Edward Snowden used Bitcoin to pay for the server on which he
          uploaded the leaks and Julian Assange had to accept Bitcoin for
          donations, when Wikileaks was cut off from all payment providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the depreciation of fiat currencies over time, one should
          conclude that everybody needs Bitcoin to protect their wealth against
          inflation.

        <h2 id="moneylaundering">Can Bitcoin be used for money laundering?</h2>
        <p>
          Money laundering is the practice of lying about where money that was
          earned from illicit activities comes from. Assume criminals want to
          spend 5 million dollars that they made by selling cocaine. When they
          buy houses, cars and other nice things with that money, they have to
          pay taxes and explain to the state where the money came from.
        </p>
        <p>
          This works by operating legitimate businesses like restaurants, car
          washes, sports betting shops etc. and pretending that the money came
          from there. The drug money gets included in those businesses profits
          and then its clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are smart, and I believe you are, you should already understand
          that Bitcoin is not very helpful here. If they sell drugs for Bitcoin
          and later want to spend it they still have to explain to authorities
          where those Bitcoin came from. Aside from this, every Bitcoin
          transaction is public to everyone and saved for eternity

        <p>
          Bitcoins are created in a process called mining, which also makes
          Bitcoin so secure. Bitcoin miners have to find a certain number that
          requires a lot of computing power to find. Once they have found this
          number, they get Bitcoins as a reward and are allowed to add the next
          block to the blockchain, in other words, to add the next batch of
          transactions to the ledger. If they try to cheat by creating fake
          Bitcoin for themselves, their block gets rejected and the reward goes
          to an honest miner.

          This is the best video I have found on how the Bitcoin blockchain and
          mining works. It slowly explains the most important parts (blocks,
          nonces, hashes) and how they work together in making Bitcoin secure.

        <h2 id="stateattack">Could a state attack Bitcoin?</h2>
        <p>
          <b>A State can not buy enough hardware for a 51% attack.</b> The
          number of manufacturers is well known and there is a shortage of
          miners. All manufacturing facilities are running at full capacity
          producing chips for graphics cards, AI and supercomputers. Since the
          existing installed number of miners is many times larger than the
          annual production of new miners, a nation state would need to buy all
          the supply of hardware manufacturers worldwide for many years, just to
          be able to reach 51%. This makes entering the market secretly
          impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Only theoretically can a state manufacture enough miners for a 51%
            attack.</b
          >
          It has to spend billions for the facilities, billions for the
          production and hundreds of millions for the energy and would not
          achieve much. <b>With a 51% attack you do not control Bitcoin.</b> The
          only thing you can do is make fake transactions and block transactions
          for a short period of time. Both attacks are identifiable and can be
          remedied by the Bitcoin ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p>
          The state can get mining rewards about half the time but these
          Bitcoins would be identifiable and can be rejected by the Bitcoin
          community. Hence, the state can not profit from mining and would be
          competing with profitable miners.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a short period of time, the Bitcoin ecosystem would decide to
          fork off the attacking state miners and cause a chain split
          (bifurcation of the bitcoin network into two):
        </p>

        <p>1. original-bitcoin-chain. 2. state-attack-chain.</p>

        <p>
          After this bifurcation the attacking state miners will be mining on
          the state-attack-chain and not affect the original-bitcoin-chain
          anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result of this failed nation state attack would increase the
          confidence in Bitcoin and send Bitcoin prices soaring.

        <p>
          It may not be a good idea to spend too much Bitcoin since we are still
          in the early stages of adoption (less then 1% of the world population
          owns Bitcoin) but it may be fun to do so now and then.
